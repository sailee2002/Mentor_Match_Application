## Mentor_Match_Application
# Project Overview
The Mentor Match Application is a data-driven platform developed to efficiently match student applicants with suitable mentors based on their defined career goals.

This project was unique in that it involved building the entire dataset from scratch, which was crucial for deeply understanding attribute relationships and user interactions. We then leveraged this custom-built dataset to simulate real-world usage, extract key business metrics using SQL, and visualize trends using Python.

# Technical Contributions & Key Features
1. Data Structuring & Management (SQL)
Database Design: Structured and imported the custom-generated data into a SQL database (e.g., SQL Server or PostgreSQL) to establish a relational model between applicants, mentors, career goals, and sessions.

Efficient Data Handling: Ensured data integrity and efficient querying through proper schema design and indexing.

2. Analytical Querying & Business Insights (SQL)
Executed complex SQL queries to derive key business and operational insights, including:

Payment Analysis: Queried transactional data to understand payment frequency, total revenue, and high-value mentors.

Mentor Load Analysis: Calculated the number of applicants assigned to each mentor to assess capacity and matching efficiency.

User Relationship Mapping: Analyzed the connection between various user attributes to understand relationship longevity and success rates.

3. Data Visualization & Reporting (Python)
Utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to perform in-depth analysis and create compelling visualizations of the data extracted via SQL.

Performance Dashboards: Visualized sales trends, payment patterns, and mentor-applicant ratios.

Attribute Relation Mapping: Created charts to show the connection between attributes (e.g., how a specific career goal impacts session duration or mentor choice).

User Engagement: Analyzed and visualized user engagement and session patterns to inform platform improvements.

# Impact
This project demonstrates proficiency in building an end-to-end data pipeline, from initial data creation and database structuring to advanced SQL querying and compelling data visualization for actionable business insights. The analytical output provides a clear mechanism for optimizing the mentor-applicant matching algorithm and understanding user behavior to drive platform success.

# Future Enhancements
Integrate a machine learning model to predict the probability of a successful match.

Implement a full web interface to showcase the data entry and matching process.
